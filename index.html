    <h1>Conditionals in Javascript</h1>
    <p>
        Conditionals are statements that help your program make decisions.
They check if something is true or false, and then execute different code depending on the result.
    </p>
    <p>
         1.if Statement <br>
         
        Used to run code only if a condition is true.
        
        eg: //let age = 18;

//if (age >= 18) {
  //console.log("You are an adult.");
}

    </p>
    <p>
        2. if.. else
       Runs one block if the condition is true, and another block if itâ€™s false.  
       eg:
       let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}

    </p>
    <p>
        3. if else if else ladder <br>
       Used when you have multiple conditions to check. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            4. Switch Statement: <br>
            Used when you need to compare one value to many possible cases.


        </p>
        <h1>
             5.TERNANRY OPERATOR (Short if... else)
            <p>
                A quick way to write conditionals in one line.

                eg: let age = 20;
//let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
//console.log(result); // output : Adult

            </p>

        </h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note:
       1. Always use break to stop the code from running into the next case.

    2.default runs if none of the cases match.
    </p>
